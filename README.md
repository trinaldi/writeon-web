# WriteOn

I'm *specially* a moron when it comes to React at this point of time

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Rationale

This is your beginner todo app suited to my needs. I have a notebook with this 
exact same layout and content. The goal is practice while keeping my notes, thougths 
and other stuff up to date.

## Running

As mentioned above, this app was bootstraped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Hence

```sh
$ yarn start
```

will run the dev environment. The backend is fueled by [WriteOn](https://github.com/trinaldi/writeon)

## Contributing
